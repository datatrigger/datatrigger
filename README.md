Hello Internet! I am Vincent, a data practitioner based in Switzerland. Up until now, my official role has been Data Scientist, but I've been leaning more and more towards data engineering and MLOps over the past year: data modeling, data pipelines, model deployment, CI/CD frameworks, APIs...

So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and now consumer electronics. I conducted a wide variety of projects involving tools like containers (e.g. Docker), cloud providers (e.g. AWS EC2, S3, ECR...), distributed computing (e.g. Spark), databases (e.g. Snowflake) and Machine Learning (e.g PyTorch, XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn...).

I created this GitHub account to archive projects and code that might be useful to other people, including future me. All the content is under MIT license. Feel free to use anything you may find interesting. You can find more digestible versions of most of these repositories on my blog, [datatrigger.org](https://www.datatrigger.org/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datatrigger/).

Thanks for reading!
