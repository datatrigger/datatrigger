### Me, myself and I

Hello Internet! My name is Vincent Le Goualher and I currently work as a Data Scientist in Lausanne, Switzerland. I originally engaged in this field because I love both maths and software development. Now that I have some experience, I would add that discovering and solving business problems is another reason to get excited by this job.

So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and now consumer electronics. I conducted a wide variety of projects involving regression, classification, NLP, clustering, etc... Lately, I have been particularly interested in time series. I also made a deep dive into MLOps. By that I mean deploying models and implementing CI/CD using GitHub Actions, Docker containers and AWS services (ECR, ECS, EventBridge). This  ensures the models in production are accessible to the end user, maintained and monitored.

I created this GitHub account to archive methods and code that might be useful to other people, including future me. All the content is under MIT license. Feel free to use anything you may find interesting. You can find more digestible versions of most of these repositories on my blog, [datatrigger.org](datatrigger.org). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datatrigger/).

Thanks for reading!
