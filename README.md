### Me, myself and I

Hello Internet ! My name is Vincent Le Goualher, I am *(current_year - 1990)*  years old and I currently work as a data scientist in Lausanne, Switzerland. My job involves analysing datasets, visualizing trends, using machine learning to model phenomena and building/deploying applications to predict behaviors or make decisions. So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and now consumer electronics. Unsurprinsingly, I am a heavy user of Python tools such as pandas, PyTorch, ðŸ¤— Hugging Face and many others. But I am also a big fan of R's Tidyverse, ggplot2 and Shiny, as well as a few other packages. I am passionate about my field and more generally about maths and computer science.  

I created this GitHub account to archive methods and code that might be useful to other people, including future me. All the content is under MIT license. Feel free to use anything you may find interesting :)
