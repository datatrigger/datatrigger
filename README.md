Hello Internet! I am Vincent, a data practitioner based in Switzerland. I have been focusing on Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and Data Engineering projects over the past few years: CI/CD frameworks, containers, APIs, data pipelines..

So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and now consumer electronics. I conducted a wide variety of projects involving tools like containers (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), cloud providers (AWS, GCP), distributed computing (e.g. Spark), databases (e.g. Snowflake) and Machine Learning (e.g PyTorch, XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn...).

I created this GitHub account to archive projects and code that might be useful to other people, including future me. All the content is under MIT license. Feel free to use anything you may find interesting. You can find more digestible versions of most of these repositories on my blog, [datatrigger.org](https://www.datatrigger.org/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datatrigger/).

Thanks for reading!
