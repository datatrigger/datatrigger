Hi, I’m Vincent — a Software Engineer based in Switzerland. I specialize in backend development, data engineering and DevOps. Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to projects across public health, finance, consumer electronics, transportation, and social insurance. My daily toolkit includes:
* **Languages \& Tools**: Java, Spring, Scala, Spark, Python, SQL, Bash, Git, GitHub, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions
* **DevOps/MLOPs**: CI/CD pipelines, containerized application deployment, automated testing, IaC, monitoring & alerting
* **Cloud & Data Platforms**: AWS (IAM, S3, Athena, Glue, Lambda, ECS), Azure (Databricks, Data Factory, Storage), Snowflake
* **Data Engineering**: Data modeling, ETL pipelines, data warehousing, orchestration management

I created this GitHub account to archive projects and code that might be useful to others — including my future self. All the content is under MIT license. Feel free to use anything you may find interesting. You can find more digestible versions of most of these repositories on my blog, [vlg.engineer](https://vlg.engineer/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlg-engineer/).

Thanks for reading!
