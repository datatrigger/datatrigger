Hello Internet! I am Vincent, a Software Engineer based in Switzerland. I have been focusing on Data Engineering and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) over the past few years: data pipelines, CI/CD frameworks, workflow management, APIs..

So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and consumer electronics. I conducted a wide variety of projects involving tools like containers (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), cloud providers (AWS, GCP), distributed computing (e.g. Spark), databases (e.g. Snowflake) and Machine Learning (e.g PyTorch, XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn...). I use Linux shells, Git/GitHub, Python and SQL on a daily basis.

I created this GitHub account to archive projects and code that might be useful to other people, including future me. All the content is under MIT license. Feel free to use anything you may find interesting. You can find more digestible versions of most of these repositories on my blog, [blog.vlgdata.io](https://blog.vlgdata.io/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlgdata/).

Thanks for reading!
