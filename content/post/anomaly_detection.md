title: Outlier detection
subtitle: It turns to be quite different from clustering
summary: In this post, I try to define what an outlier is and I present several ways to approach the problem of anomaly detection. Then, I go more in depth about the method called Local Outlier Factor. After a brief introduction about the mathematical foundations of this algorithm, I apply it on a specific dataset to show its power, using both Python and R.
