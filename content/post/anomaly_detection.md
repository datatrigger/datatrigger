title: Outlier detection
subtitle: It turns to be quite different from clustering
summary: In this post, I try to define what an outlier is and I present several ways to approach the problem of anomaly detection. Then, I go more in depth about the method called Local Outlier Factor. After a brief introduction about the mathematical foundations of this algorithm, I apply it on a specific dataset to show its power, using both Python and R.

## What is an outlier ?  
&nbsp;
![What is an outlier ?](/img/res/same_but_different.resized.jpg)  

An outlier can be defined as *an observation that appears to deviate markedly from other members of the sample in which it occurs* [1]. The question that immediately arises is the following : is this observation inconsistent ? Meaning was it generated by a different mechanism, or is it just "bad luck" ? This problem is kind of important, since as Fran√ßois Chollet (creator of the API Keras) recently tweeted :

There are quite a few methods to study outliers and eventually detect anomalies. They can be classified in several ways.  
  
Firstly, some methods are global as opposed to local algorithms, which only use the $k \in \mathbb{N}$ nearest neighbors.
