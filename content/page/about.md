---
Hi, I’m Vincent — a Software Engineer based in Switzerland. I specialize in backend development, data engineering and DevOps. Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to projects across public health, finance, consumer electronics, transportation, and social insurance. My daily toolkit includes:
* **Languages \& Tools**: Java, Spring, Scala, Spark, Python, SQL, Bash, Git, GitHub, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions
* **DevOps/MLOPs**: CI/CD pipelines, containerized application deployment, automated testing, IaC, monitoring & alerting
* **Cloud & Data Platforms**: AWS (IAM, S3, Athena, Glue, Lambda, ECS), Azure (Databricks, Data Factory, Storage), Snowflake
* **Data Engineering**: Data modeling, ETL pipelines, data warehousing, orchestration management

I built this website to document projects, code, and thoughts that might be useful to others — including my future self. All the content is under MIT license and the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/datatrigger).

Thanks for reading!
