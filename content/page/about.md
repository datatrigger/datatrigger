## Me, myself and I


Hello Internet! My name is Vincent Le Goualher and I currently work as a Data Scientist in Lausanne, Switzerland. I originally engaged in this field because I love both maths and software development. Now that I have some experience, I would add that discovering and solving business problems is another reason to get excited by this job.

So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and now consumer electronics. I conducted a wide variety of projects involving regression, classification, NLP, clustering, etc... Lately, I have been particularly interested in time series. I also made a deep dive into MLOps to ensure the models in production are accessible to the end user, maintained and monitored.

Unsurprinsingly, I am a heavy user of Python libraries such as pandas, PyTorch, transformers and many others. But I am also a big fan of R's Tidyverse, ggplot2 and Shiny, as well as a few other packages. My daily tools also include Git/GitHub, Docker and a few AWS services such as ECR, ECS, EventBridge or S3. I created this website to archive methods and code that might be useful to other people, including future me.
