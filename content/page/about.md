## Me, myself and I


My name is Vincent Le Goualher, I am 30 years old and I currently work as a data scientist in Paris. I analyse datasets and use machine learning (formerly known as statistics) to understand phenomena, model them and eventually predict behaviors. Unsurprinsingly, I am a heavy user of Python tools such as pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch and many others. But I am also a big fan of R's Tidyverse and ggplot2. I am passionate about my field and more generally about maths and computer science.  

I created this website to archive methods and code that might be useful for future me (most likely) or other people. All the content is under MIT license. The source code can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/datatrigger).
