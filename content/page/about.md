title: About me
---

Hello Internet! I am Vincent, a data practitioner based in Switzerland. I have been focusing on Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and Data Engineering projects over the past few years: CI/CD frameworks, containers, APIs, data pipelines...

So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health, financial services and now consumer electronics. I conducted a wide variety of projects involving tools like containers (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), cloud providers (AWS, GCP), distributed computing (e.g. Spark), databases (e.g. Snowflake) and Machine Learning (e.g PyTorch, XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn...).

I created this website to archive projects and code that might be useful to other people, including future me. All the content is under MIT license and the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/datatrigger).

Thanks for reading!
