## Me, myself and I


Hello Internet ! My name is Vincent Le Goualher, I am 30 years old and I currently work as a data scientist in Paris. My job involves analysing datasets, visualizing trends, using machine learning to model phenomena and building/deploying applications to predict behaviors or make decisions. I have worked in various industries such as online shopping, public health and financial services. Unsurprinsingly, I am a heavy user of Python tools such as pandas, PyTorch, Dash, PySpark and many others. But I am also a big fan of R's Tidyverse and ggplot2, as well as a few other tools. I am passionate about my field and more generally about maths and computer science.  

I created this website to archive methods and code that might be useful for future me (most likely) or other people. All the content is under MIT license. The source code can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/datatrigger).
