      <description>Take too independent random variables identically distributed. Question: if their sum is large, are they likely to be both large ? Let us examine this question with contour plots.</description>

      <title>Adding totals and subtotals rows with pandas or the tidyverse</title>

      <description>When dealing with a dataframe, generating aggregate data is a very common task. In my experience, presenting the summary statistics for the whole population or for subgroups directly in the dataframe can be useful, if not necessary. Today, I present my recipe to achieve this with the pandas and tidyverse packages.</description>

      <description>Splitting and scaling a dataset seems easy. Well, it is admittedly not that hard, however it can be tricky. Today we will see how to properly split and scale a dataset, as this step if often necessary before any ML wizardry. Let us do this with a few R &amp;amp; Python packages/modules.</description>

      <title>Weighted Random Forest with Spark 3</title>

      <description>The third version of the number one distributed computing framework Spark was released in June 2020. Sample weights support was implemented for tree-based algorithms : decision tree, gradient tree boosting and random forest. Today we experiment with this new feature on an imbalanced dataset about credit card fraud.</description>

      <title>Outlier detection</title>

      <description>In this post, I try to define what an outlier is and I present several ways to approach the problem of anomaly detection. Then, I present the Local Outlier Factor algorithm and apply it on a specific dataset to show its power, using both Python and R. I also compare its performance with the Isolation Forest method.</description>

      <description>Me, myself and I Hello Internet ! My name is Vincent Le Goualher, I am 30 years old and I currently work as a data scientist in Paris. My job involves analysing datasets, visualizing trends, using machine learning to model phenomena and building/deploying applications to predict behaviors or make decisions. So far, I have worked in several domains, namely public health and financial services. Unsurprinsingly, I am a heavy user of Python tools such as pandas, PyTorch, PySpark and many others.</description>
